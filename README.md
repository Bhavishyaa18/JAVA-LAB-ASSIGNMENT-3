## 📌 Project Description  
This project is a console-based **Student Registration System** built in Java.  
It allows users to add student details, calculate grades, search students by roll number, and view all stored student records.  
The program uses **Exception Handling**, **Interfaces**, **Custom Exceptions**, **Threads (Loader animation)**, and **OOP concepts**.  
All student data is stored in a **LinkedHashMap**, ensuring fast lookup and ordered output.  
The system also validates user inputs such as email format, marks range, and non-empty fields to ensure consistent data entry.
